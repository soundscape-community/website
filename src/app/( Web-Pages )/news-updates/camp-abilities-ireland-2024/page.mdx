# Camp Abilities Ireland 2024 – Orienteering

<span className="font-work-sans text-navy-blue text-xl font-normal pb-6">July 14, 2024</span>

Testing any app is a meticulous process that requires attention to detail and a rigorous, well
planned structure to ensure all aspects of the functionality are explored. That’s why we
chose 39 children with vision impairment to use Soundscape Community while orienteering,
in the wet Irish countryside! Yes, we set ourselves a challenge but we had a unique
opportunity and a great bunch of people to work with and the rainy weather and wet grass
couldn’t dampen our ambition!

    Set up in Ireland in 2010, adopted from the model established by Lauren Lieberman in New
York, Camp Abilities is a Vision Sports Ireland annual residential sports and leisure activities
camp for young people who are blind or vision impaired.

    As an Orientation and Mobility Instructor, I have always been interested in motion and
movement. As soon as I started working with children, I became involved in Camp Abilities
as it presented a wonderful opportunity to develop fundamental movement skills and
confidence in a fun and exciting way. For these young people, this is one of the few
opportunities to meet with others who also have a vision impairment because many of these
children do not have someone in their class or even in their school with a similar condition.

        Camp Abilities Ireland 2024 brought together 39 vision impaired ‘campers’ alongside a team
of 30 dedicated volunteers and staff at the Kilfinane Outdoor Education and Training Centre
in Limerick. Throughout the week, campers are immersed in an array of activities from
kayaking to rock climbing, cycling to camp craft and soccer to a park run. Each day offers
opportunities for campers to push their boundaries and discover their potential, all the while
promoting the camp values of Being Active, Being Social and Being Independent.
Orienteering was added to the schedule for this year. Always interested in harnessing
technology for independence, I saw this as an ideal opportunity to put Soundscape
Community to the test with this discerning group! Plenty of prep work was put in by all,
including Kilfinane staff who planned out the route, placed the audio beacons at the flags,
labelled with descriptions that provided the right amount of information – not too much, not
too little! The trail went through various environments, knowing that these young people
would like to be challenged and it proved to be a very popular activity. We were very
interested in how everyone would get on with the app and we gave all the chance to let us
know through our feedback forms.

       It was easy to observe how quickly the children grasped the use of the app and understood
the purpose. Large print maps were produced for those who could use them but as Lucy
said *"if you couldn&#39;t read a map then you could listen to a map"*. Those using the app often got
a head start on the trail as they started to move in the right direction while those using the
printed version were getting their bearings.

There was a lot of positive feedback given about the ease of using the app and the
accessibility of it. However, for me, it was truly amazing to see the difference it caused in
body language, posture and confidence for those using the app. Heads were held high and
smiles on faces as a more even playing field was perceived – contradicted by the actual
terrain, but everyone in the team now had their role to play, and each role was of value.

### Camper account of Soundscape Community at Camp Abilities Ireland 2024

It’s my 2nd time at Camp and already I can’t wait until next year. We had new activities this
year and we got to test an app on the phone to see if it was good when we were
orienteering. It was fun to be a tester even in the lashing rain! The app beeped and binged
when you pointed in the right direction for the flag. You could have different noises which
was good. My team was faster than the other team who used a map. I told them that I think
there should more sounds when you get to the flag and I can&#39;t wait to see how the app gets
even better with our help!

### Parent Experience of Soundscape Community, Camp Abilities 24

My son has not stopped talking about Camp since we picked him up. One of the things we
heard about was the Soundscape app. He had never done orienteering before because he
can’t see a map and now he wants us to find a local group so he can join. It’s great to see
that this can happen.
