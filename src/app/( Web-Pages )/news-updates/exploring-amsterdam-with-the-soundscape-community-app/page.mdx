Hey there! I'm Frazier, one of the contributors to the Soundscape Community project. A friend of mine is heading to Amsterdam next month for a quick city break and asked me for some tips since I've been there before. Today, I'm sharing how I used the “Routes” feature in the Soundscape Community app to plan their trip. I hope you not only learn about this awesome feature but also see how much fun I had revisiting my Amsterdam adventure and highlighting some must-see spots for my friend.
Soundscape Community works worldwide, so you can travel with it and enjoy a familiar experience in your language of choice.
My friend only has a weekend in Amsterdam and wants to make the most of it. So, I created a walking itinerary for a day using a Route and added some Markers for other cool places to check out.

### What is a Soundscape Community Route?

Soundscape Community Routes are like a trail of Audio Beacons. Here's the gist:

- A Route is a sequence of Markers connected together, ending at a specific destination.
- When you reach one Marker, the Audio Beacon automatically sets to the next one.
- You can use Markers as waypoints to help navigate to your destination more easily.
- Routes can be shared and customized based on your guidance preferences—whether you want frequent Markers or just a few key spots.

The Soundscape Community Route is super personalizable, whether you're creating it for yourself or sharing it with someone else.

### My Amsterdam Adventure

I visited Amsterdam during their annual Light Festival, which features amazing light installations around the city. My top tip was to go during this festival!

My day's plan included a hearty breakfast, museum visits, exploring the city's architecture, and finishing with a boat tour of the light installations. And, of course, enjoying some great food along the way.

    <div className="flex flex-col">
        <b>Starting with breakfast</b>: The first Marker I created was for 'Bakers and Roasters, a fantastic spot for a hearty breakfast. It's just a short walk from Amsterdam's Museum District, making it a perfect start to the day.

    <Image className="h-auto md:w-[20rem] w-[16rem] rounded-lg mb-8" src={BaconsEggsAvacado} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the breakfast." />
</div>

<b>First stop - Rijksmuseum</b>: After breakfast, it's off to the Rijksmuseum, one of the most visited museums in the Netherlands. This grand building is dedicated to Dutch arts and history. Don’t miss the picturesque Research Library inside—it’s a hidden gem!

<Image className="h-auto md:w-[12rem] w-[12rem] rounded-lg mb-8 mx-auto" src={AmsterdamDayPlan} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the app screen." />

The Van Gogh Museum is also nearby, so my friend can easily switch things up and visit another museum if they want. With Soundscape Community, even if they venture off-route, the Audio Beacon will guide them back.

**Next - Anne Frank House**: The Anne Frank House is in Jordaan, about a 30-minute walk from the Rijksmuseum. Amsterdam’s pedestrian-friendly layout makes walking along the canals a delightful experience. I placed a few intermediate Markers to guide my friend through Jordaan, allowing time to explore the neighborhood and grab a light lunch in one of the cosy cafes.

<div className="flex mt-8 xl:flex-row flex-col gap-4 xl:items-start items-center justify-center">
    <Image className="w-auto md:h-[18rem] h-[12rem] rounded-lg mb-8" src={AmsterdamCity2} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the city." />
    <Image className="w-auto md:h-[18rem] h-[12rem] rounded-lg mb-8" src={AmsterdamCity} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of 2 tall and narrow buildings in front of a canal." />
</div>

*Fun fact: it is said that the houses have so many windows because the windows are lighter than walls, and this helped to stop the subsidence caused by soft ground that the city is built on.*

<Image className="h-auto md:w-[18rem] w-[12rem] rounded-lg mb-8 mx-auto" src={AmsterdamWaypointsPic} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the app screen." />

**Anne Frank House**: This Marker comes with a note to book tickets in advance to avoid long queues—a tip I emphasized in the email sharing the Route.

<Image className="h-auto md:w-[18rem] w-[12rem] rounded-lg mb-8 mx-auto" src={AnneFrankHouse } height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the app screen showing information about anne frank's house." />

***Soundscape Note:** The distance shown on this screen will always be to your current location. Here it is showing the distance from where I was creating the Markers, but once you are in Amsterdam, the distances will be more meaningful.*

**Dinner at Jacketz**: Before the boat tour, it’s time for dinner at ‘Jacketz,’ a central Amsterdam spot known for its delicious jacket potatoes with various toppings. It’s a quick meal to enjoy before heading to the boat tour.

**Boat tour**: The boat tour showcases the best sights of the Light Festival from a unique canal-level perspective. I even thought about creating some Soundscape Community Markers along the canal tour to highlight things not mentioned on the tour.

After the boat tour, it’s worth checking out other Light Festival installations on the walk back to the hotel.

**More Recommendations**

I also added extra Markers for other days, including:

**Narrowest house in Amsterdam**: Houses used to be taxed based on their façade size, leading to some tall, thin buildings.

<Image className="w-auto max-w-[80%] md:h-[32rem] h-[24rem] rounded-lg mb-8 mx-auto " src={NarrowestHouse} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the app screen." />

**Food spots**: A cosy café in a library for breakfast and a burger joint offering a trio of mini-burgers.

**Museums**: The Amsterdam Museum for local history and the Van Gogh Museum for art enthusiasts. Plus, the Heineken factory tour for a fun, weather-proof activity.

**Landmarks**:
- **Magere Brug (Skinny Bridge)**: A charming bridge illuminated at night.
- **Dam Square**: The historical center with the Royal Palace and other attractions.

<Image className="w-auto max-w-[80%] md:h-[32rem] h-[24rem] rounded-lg mb-8 mx-auto " src={MagereBrug} height={0} width={0} alt="An image of the app screen." />

Creating this itinerary took about 15 minutes and was a great way to revisit my trip. My friend checked out the Route, added a few of their own Markers, and now they’re all set to explore Amsterdam! Stay tuned for an update on how they enjoyed using Soundscape Community to navigate the city as a tourist!
