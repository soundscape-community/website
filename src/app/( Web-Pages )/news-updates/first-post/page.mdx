        Hi, I’m Frazier from the Soundscape Team. One of my friends is going on a city break to Amsterdam next month and asked me for some tips of things to do there, as they know I’ve been before. Today, I am sharing how I did this using Soundscape’s latest feature, “Routes”. In this blog, I hope you will not only learn about this amazing new feature, but how much fun it was to revisit my trip and be able to share a few highlights with my friend. Soundscape will work anywhere in the world, so you can travel with it and have your familiar experience in your language of choice.
        My friend only has a weekend in Amsterdam and wants to pack in as much as possible.

My friend only has a weekend in Amsterdam and wants to pack in as much as possible. 

My plan was to create a walking itinerary for a day using a Route, and then also share some Markers of other places they might like to visit while they are there.
At the bottom of this blog, you’ll find links to all the Markers mentioned, so you can try them out for yourself!

### What is a Soundscape Route?

Soundscape Routes are like a trail of Audio Beacons – a feature of Soundscape which plays a sound which always comes from the direction of the place it’s set on. (Read about Audio Beacons in our ‘Getting Fresh Air with Microsoft Soundscape’ blog). In fact:
- A Soundscape Route is a sequence of Soundscape Markers joined together and finishing at a destination.
- When arriving at one of the Markers on the Route, instead of switching off, the Audio Beacon will automatically set on the next Marker.
- You can use Markers as intermediate waypoints along your Route to help you navigate to your end destination with greater ease.
- Routes can be shared, and each person is able to edit the Route based on their preferred style of guidance, some may want very frequent Markers, whereas others may prefer to only have Markers at key spots along the way.

The Soundscape ‘Route’ is a personal experience and can be tailored to individual preferences, whether you are creating it for yourself, or to share with someone else!

I visited Amsterdam with my girlfriend between Christmas and New Year, it happened to be the time of year that they have their annual Light Festival with several light installations around the city. My first recommendation was to go while this was on!
My plan for the day was to grab a filling breakfast, go to a museum or two, walk around the city to appreciate the architecture, finishing with a boat tour to see the fabulous light installations, all while keeping well-fueled at some cafés and restaurants I had particularly enjoyed while I was there.

### Starting the day off right

Beginning with breakfast, the first Marker I’m creating is for ‘Bakers and Roasters’. This is a great spot for a hearty breakfast to start the day! My friend is staying over on this side of the city, so launching the Route when he leaves his hotel should give him a nice simple walk to the café. Plus, it’s only a few minutes’ walk from Amsterdam’s Museum district so it fits in perfectly with the plan for the day.

### Waypoint 2: Rijksmuseum

        The first stop after breakfast is the Rijksmuseum, while it’s still early in the day. This is one of the most visited museums in the Netherlands! It is the national museum of the Netherlands and is dedicated to Dutch arts and history. The museum is in a huge, grand building, I’d make sure to allow plenty of time to walk around the grounds and take in the architecture!

        In the museum, along with all the exhibits, you will also find the ‘Research Library’, the largest art history library in the Netherlands. This was one of my favourite parts of the museum – after walking around looking at all the art and historical artefacts, this picturesque, working library was somewhat unexpected!

        There are several other museums in this area, such as the Van Gogh Museum, so if my friend would like to visit somewhere else then they can easily try a different museum without going far from the Route. In fact, the beauty of a Soundscape Route is that it doesn’t matter how far from the Route you might want to venture as the Audio Beacon will always be audible from wherever you may be. You can make a little detour and then just follow the sound of the Audio Beacon back to where you branched off! In this way, Soundscape gives you the freedom and flexibility to explore and discover a place on your own terms.
